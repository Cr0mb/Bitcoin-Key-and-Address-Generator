# Bitcoin-Key-and-Address-Generator
This repository contains Python scripts to generate Bitcoin private keys, public keys, mnemonic phrases, and addresses. It demonstrates key generation, address creation (legacy &amp; SegWit), and mnemonic backup. The first script generates a single address, while the second continuously generates new addresses.
